If your project is a simulator management tool:
This utility provides a convenient way to manage and control your Xcode simulators directly from the command line or a simple graphical interface. [3, 19] It simplifies tasks such as booting, shutting down, and resetting simulators, making your development workflow more efficient. [4, 8]
